    <h2 class="sentence">The new connection button</h2>

First ***click*** the [Open Connection button](https://www.exavault.com/docs/ftp-clients/cyberduck/01-connecting) in the `Cyberduck` ***toolbar***. You will ***need*** to ***enter*** a few ***details*** to get ***connected***:

+ `Protocol`: `SFTP` is ***strongly*** recommended.

+ `Server`: This is your `server IP address`.

+ ***Click*** the `Connect` ***button*** to ***connect*** to your ***account***.

The `username` that you should ***use*** is the one that is ***sent*** to you ***after*** you have ***purchased*** your `hosting plan` with `Namecheap`. It will ***contain*** the `username` and `password` for your `cpanel` ***log in***, and it will ***also*** give you the `server` ***information*** and `url` ***options***. 

I did have one ***little*** `problem` with the `URL` to ***use*** if my `DNS` was ***not*** `propagated` ***yet*** (which it ***wasn't*** at the ***time*** of this ***slide deck***). ***Try*** it with the `/cpanel` ***extension***, and if ***that*** does ***not*** work, ***try*** it ***without*** it.

If you have ***any*** `problems` ***setting up*** `outside` of ***class time***, please ***reach out*** to me on `Discord`, and I will be ***very*** happy to ***assist*** you!

Once you have ***connected*** with your ***remote server*** on `Namecheap`, ***click*** on the `folder` ***called*** `home`. Once it has ***expanded***, ***click*** on the `folder` ***inside*** the `home folder` which has the ***same name*** as your `cPanel username`. When your `"username" folder` ***expands*** upon ***click***, You will see ***another*** `folder` ***inside*** called `"public_html".` ***That*** is the `root folder` of your `web site`, and ***where*** you ***should*** be ***uploading*** your `files` and `folders` at the ***root*** of the *`public_html`* `folder`. If they are ***not uploaded*** there, ***nothing*** will be ***pointing*** to your `site`, and the `site pages` will be ***blank***!
